*   **Dataset Name:** Heart Disease
*   **Abstract:** This dataset comprises 4 databases: Cleveland, Hungary, Switzerland, and the VA Long Beach.
*   **Creators:** Andras Janosi, William Steinbrunn, Matthias Pfisterer, Robert Detrano
*   **Year of Dataset Creation:** 1989
*   **Last Updated:** Fri Nov 03 2023

*   **Characteristics:** Multivariate
*   **Number of Instances:** 303
*   **Number of Features:** 13
*   **Feature Types:** Categorical, Integer, Real
*   **Demographics:** Includes Age and Sex information.
*   **Target Column:** 'num' (diagnosis of heart disease)
*   **Missing Values:** Yes, indicated by 'NaN'.

#### Additional Important Information from `additional_info`:

*   **Summary:** This database originally contained 76 attributes, but published experiments typically use a subset of 14. The Cleveland database is the most commonly used by ML researchers. The 'goal' field refers to the presence of heart disease (values 1,2,3,4) vs. absence (value 0).
*   **Variable Information:** Only 14 attributes were used in published experiments, including:
    *   `age`: age in years
    *   `sex`: sex (1 = male; 0 = female)
    *   `cp`: chest pain type
    *   `trestbps`: resting blood pressure (in mm Hg)
    *   `chol`: serum cholestoral in mg/dl
    *   `fbs`: fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true; 0 = false)
    *   `restecg`: resting electrocardiographic results
    *   `thalach`: maximum heart rate achieved
    *   `exang`: exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)
    *   `oldpeak`: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
    *   `slope`: the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
    *   `ca`: number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy
    *   `thal`: 3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect
    *   `num`: diagnosis of heart disease (0 = < 50% narrowing, 1 = > 50% narrowing)

This provides a comprehensive overview of the dataset's origins and characteristics.
